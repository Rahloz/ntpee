NTP: 
	1. Strata numbered 0(lower strata) to 16(higher strata). Lower strata are closer to reference time source
	2. Poll between 8 seconds and 36hrs depending. Goal to maximize accuracy while minimizing network load.
	3. Protocol uses 4 timestamps:
		A. T1 = client send request timestamp
		B. T2 = server recv request timestamp
		C. T3 = server send response timestamp
		D. T4 = client recv response timestamp
	4. These timestampts are used to calc the clock offset and roundtrip delay
	5. These are calc as follows:
		A. offset = [( T2 - T1 ) + ( T3 - T4 )] / 2
		B. delay = ( T4 - T1 ) - ( T3 - T2 )
	6. Can use "Clock Filter Algorithm" to select the most accurate samples for offset and delay
	7. Can use "Clock Discipline Algorithm" to adjust the system clock time and frequency
	8. "The goal of the NTP algorithms is to minimize
	   both the time difference and frequency difference between UTC and the
	   system clock.  When these differences have been reduced below nominal
	   tolerances, the system clock is said to be synchronized to UTC."
